            <h4>How does memory recall work in the brain?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Memory recall involves reactivation of neural pathways formed during initial learning. Retrieval cues trigger the brain to reconstruct stored information from these pathways, potentially leading to altered memories over time due to the reconsolidation process.</p>

            <h4>What's the theory behind the multiverse?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p> The multiverse theory proposes the existence of multiple universes beyond our observable one. It's based on concepts from cosmology and quantum physics, suggesting that different regions of space-time could have undergone separate Big Bang events, resulting in distinct universes</p>

            <h4>Could we achieve interstellar travel?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Interstellar travel presents enormous challenges due to vast distances and energy requirements. Concepts like the "warp drive" remain speculative. Currently, our technology is far from achieving practical interstellar travel, but ongoing research explores potential solutions like advanced propulsion systems and hibernation methods.</p>

            <h4>Can CRISPR gene editing alter intelligence?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>CRISPR can potentially modify genes associated with intelligence, but it's complex. Intelligence is influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors. Ethical and societal considerations also play a role in discussing such modifications.</p>

            <h4>How does black hole formation occur?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Black holes form when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel, causing their cores to collapse under gravity. This collapse creates a singularity, surrounded by an event horizon from which nothing, not even light, can escape.</p>
